# Catering-Service-ASPNet-MVC

.Net Core 6 MVC project. 

### Scenario

The company offers its employees inhouse catering. Every day a menu is
prepared and displayed. The employees are free to place orders up to 11 oâ€™clock every
morning. Lunch is served no sooner than 13:00, and placing the orders beforehand allows the
cooks to understand how much of each food to prepare.
